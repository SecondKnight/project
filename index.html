      Honestly,I didnt expect that I would've asked you so many questions lol.I
      combed through oveer three thousand messages just to make this,from
      september 2024 to may 2025 since unfortunately I dont have the chat longs
      from my old account. now because of that I turned this page into a type of
      home page. From here,you should be able to access two seperate pages,a
      page that contains all of the questions that I ever asked you and another
      page that holds all of the questions that you ever asked me. I even used a
      C program to automate some of my work like wrapping each question with
      code. You better like this smh. You going offline gave me this
      opportunity.
    </p>

      Alright so,my questions are the ones that I asked you. Any comments I made
      will be enclosed with () and in your questions where I answered you,any
      comments I made will be enclosed in (())
