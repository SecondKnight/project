            2. Btw you remember my voice ? Lyk my new classmates says that my
            voice is too lyk the annoying type, is it tho? Like I need genuine
            one do not say it's perfect and shi I wanted to change my voice? (I
            merged these two into one)
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Your voice isnt annoying at all. They just dont like it all for some
            reason ig. You were the one who gave the most speeches in our school
            and nobody said anything about your voice so just ignore their bs.ik
            that you said that I shouldnt tell you that it's perfect,but I cant
            lie and you shouldnt feel the need to change yourself based on how
            others perceive you at all. I support you if you do want to change
            it but I think your natural voice is already beautiful enough and
            that it's perfect ((alright so I rewrote this answer because I
            answered you with a voice message or could'nt find my own answer))

            Sure if that's what you wish for,but then your family would probably
            try for another match. It's not like I'll try to limit your freedom
            or take your choices away. We could just stay as friends tbf (I

            31. Would you live with someone who doesn't talk or anything and
            it's been months? No right, i would do that so my parents wouldn't
            blame me for getting divorced since it's a big cultural shock ( a
            very big one) to get a divorce
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Yk what,I should just kidnap you since I think that's wrong as you
            have rights on your husband and your husband has rights on you .Ofc
            you can just say no to the entire marriage to avoid that .But would
            you, considering your lovely family who only thinks for your
            betterment?

            that's mostly,not entirely). I'll definitely be nostalgic,not sure
            about idealizing since you're already ideal. Ngl I feel like I
            evolved emotionally in some way. Also there's definitely a chance
            that I'd compare you with someone else. ((I still blame you for

            what's so good in me that you keep on questioning me, why is it that
            you have nothing bad to say about me, I wanted this question to ask
            you badly I tried to hold back but I can't now I'm not asking you to
            tell me what are the good in me I can't see it anyway what makes you
            stay ?
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Honestly,I never even noticed that you were trying to push me away.
            [REDACTED],YOU as a person are just that fun and enjoyable to speak
            with. Like you don't even know how calming and joyful it is to just
            speak with you. Every text of yours gives me a smile and makes me
            laugh and there's always something about you that just makes me want
            to know every single detail down to the marrow of your soul. How can
            I say anything bad about you when I can't see anything bad? Like the
            only thing that's bad is you're sometimes busy or have some
            circumstances that doesn't let you yap. (I'm actually impatient and
            clingy but for the sake of not letting you see that I just wait).
            Tell me,why do you think that's always something bad about you and
            that there's nothing ever good about you? There's no need to hold
            anything back,go ahead and say everything that you've wanted to say.
            I stay because it's you,[REDACTED] Sadaf,that's the only reason I need
            to stay. You are the most beautiful person that I have ever seen of
            both spirit and body (tbf I can't say about your body but atleast
            about your face). You can't even fathom the amount of overthinking
            that I've always had for you whenever we yap,even after you
            disappear you're still a subject of my thoughts. You hold such a
            high opinion in my mind,from when I first began to think about in
            8th and then began to assess you,that opinion grew and skyrocketed
            over time. Listen,even if you're not that good or if you're evil,it
            honestly doesn't even matter to me. Since at least you're good with
            me.
